# Problem 10: Regular Expression Matching

Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:
- '.' Matches any single character.
- '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
  def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:
    m = len(s)
    n = len(p)
    # dp[i][j] := True if s[0..i) matches p[0..j)
    dp = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = True

    def isMatch(i: int, j: int) -> bool:
      return j >= 0 and (p[j] == '.' or s[i] == p[j])

    for j, c in enumerate(p):
      if c == '*' and dp[0][j - 1]:
        dp[0][j + 1] = True

    for i in range(m):
      for j in range(n):
        if p[j] == '*':
          # The minimum index of '*' is 1.
          noRepeat = dp[i + 1][j - 1]
          doRepeat = isMatch(i, j - 1) and dp[i][j + 1]
          dp[i + 1][j + 1] = noRepeat or doRepeat
        elif isMatch(i, j):
          dp[i + 1][j + 1] = dp[i][j]

    return dp[m][n]
```
<h2>Time Complexity</h2>

The time complexity of this solution is O(m*n), where m is the length of the input string s and n is the length of the pattern p. The algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach to compute the matching status for each position in the DP table.

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>

The space complexity of this solution is O(mn), where m is the length of the input string s and n is the length of the pattern p. The DP table requires O(mn) space to store the matching status for each position in the table.

<h2>Explanation</h2>

=>I use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem.<br>
=>I define a 2D DP table dp where dp[i][j] is true if the string s[:i] matches the pattern p[:j].<br>
=>I initialize dp[0][0] to True, as an empty string matches an empty pattern.<br>
=>I iterate through each character in the pattern p:<br>
If the current character is '*', we have two cases:<br>
No repeat: dp[i+1][j-1]<br>
Do repeat: isMatch(i, j-1) and dp[i][j+1]<br>
If the current character is not '*', we check if the current characters in s and p match or if the current pattern character is '.'.<br>
Finally, we return dp[m][n], which indicates whether the entire string s matches the pattern p.
