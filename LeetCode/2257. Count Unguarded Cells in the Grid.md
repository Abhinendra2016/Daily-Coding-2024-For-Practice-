# Problem 2257: Count Unguarded Cells in the Grid

You are given two integers `m` and `n` representing a 0-indexed `m x n` grid. You are also given two 2D integer arrays `guards` and `walls` where `guards[i] = [rowi, coli]` and `walls[j] = [rowj, colj]` represent the positions of the ith guard and jth wall, respectively.

A guard can see every cell in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, or west) starting from their position unless obstructed by a wall or another guard. A cell is **guarded** if there is at least one guard that can see it.

Return the number of **unoccupied** cells that are not guarded.

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
m = 4, n = 6, guards = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,3]], walls = [[0,1],[2,2],[1,4]]

<h2>Output:</h2>
7
<h2>Explanation:</h2>

Red cells are guarded.
Green cells are unguarded.
There are 7 unguarded cells in total.

<h2>Example 2:</h2>
Input:
m = 3, n = 3, guards = [[1,1]], walls = [[0,1],[1,0],[2,1],[1,2]]

<h2>Output:
4
<h2>Explanation:</h2>

Green cells are unguarded.
There are 4 unguarded cells in total.
