# Longest Increasing Subsequence

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

**Example 2:**
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4

**Example 3:**
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1


### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution

### Python Code

```python
from typing import List
import bisect

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        tails = []
        for num in nums:
            if not tails or num > tails[-1]:
                tails.append(num)
            else:
                tails[bisect.bisect_left(tails, num)] = num
        return len(tails)
```

<h2>Explanation</h2>
Initialization: Create an empty list tails that will store the smallest possible tail value for all increasing subsequences of different lengths.<br>
Processing Each Element:<br>
If the tails list is empty or the current number is greater than the last element in tails, append the number to tails.
Otherwise, find the position where the number would replace an element in tails to maintain the smallest possible tail values using binary search (bisect_left).<br>
Result: The length of the tails list represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.<br>
