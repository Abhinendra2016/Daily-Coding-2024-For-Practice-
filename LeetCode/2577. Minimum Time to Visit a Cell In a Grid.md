# Problem 2577: Minimum Time to Visit a Cell In a Grid

## Problem Description

You are given an `m x n` matrix `grid` consisting of non-negative integers where `grid[row][col]` represents the minimum time required to visit the cell `(row, col)`. You can visit the cell `(row, col)` only when the time you visit it is greater than or equal to `grid[row][col]`.

- You start at the top-left cell `(0, 0)` at `t = 0`.
- You can move to any adjacent cell in the four directions (up, down, left, and right), and each move takes 1 second.

The task is to return the **minimum time** required to visit the bottom-right cell `(m-1, n-1)`. If it is **not possible** to reach the bottom-right cell, return `-1`.

### Examples

#### Example 1
**Input:**

grid = [[0, 1, 3, 2],
        [5, 1, 2, 5],
        [4, 3, 8, 6]]
Output: 7

Explanation: One possible path is as follows:

At t = 0, start at cell (0, 0).
At t = 1, move to cell (0, 1) (grid[0][1] <= 1).
At t = 2, move to cell (1, 1) (grid[1][1] <= 2).
At t = 3, move to cell (1, 2) (grid[1][2] <= 3).
At t = 4, move to cell (1, 1) again.
At t = 5, move to cell (1, 2).
At t = 6, move to cell (1, 3) (grid[1][3] <= 6).
At t = 7, move to cell (2, 3) (grid[2][3] <= 7).
The minimum time is 7.

<h2>Example 2</h2>

Input:grid = 
[[0, 2, 4],
        [3, 2, 1],
        [1, 0, 4]]
Output: -1

Explanation: It is not possible to reach the bottom-right cell.

<h2>Constraints</h2>
m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
2 <= m, n <= 1000
4 <= m * n <= 10^5
0 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^5
grid[0][0] == 0


Solution

Approach
The problem can be solved using Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue (minHeap), as we need to calculate the minimum time to reach the destination (m-1, n-1). The key steps are:

Use a min-heap to always process the cell with the smallest "time" first.
For each cell, check all its valid neighbors and calculate the time to move there.
Handle the waiting time if the next cell's minimum time (grid[x][y]) is greater than the current time.
Mark cells as "visited" to prevent revisiting.

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def minimumTime(self, grid: list[list[int]]) -> int:
        if grid[0][1] > 1 and grid[1][0] > 1:
            return -1

        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        minHeap = [(0, 0, 0)]  # (time, i, j)
        seen = {(0, 0)}

        while minHeap:
            time, i, j = heapq.heappop(minHeap)
            if i == m - 1 and j == n - 1:
                return time
            for dx, dy in directions:
                x, y = i + dx, j + dy
                if 0 <= x < m and 0 <= y < n and (x, y) not in seen:
                    extraWait = 1 if (grid[x][y] - time) % 2 == 0 else 0
                    nextTime = max(time + 1, grid[x][y] + extraWait)
                    heapq.heappush(minHeap, (nextTime, x, y))
                    seen.add((x, y))

        return -1
```

<h2>Time Complexity</h2>
Heap operations: Each cell is pushed and popped from the heap at most once.
O(m * n log(m * n))<br>

Neighbor exploration: Each cell has up to 4 neighbors.<br>
O(m * n)
Total: O(m * n log(m * n))

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>
Heap storage: Stores up to m * n elements.<br>
O(m * n)<br>
Visited set: Stores up to m * n elements.<br>
O(m * n)<br>
Total: O(m * n)<br>
