# 959. Regions Cut By Slashes

This repository contains a Python solution for the problem "959. Regions Cut By Slashes" on LeetCode. The problem involves calculating the number of contiguous regions created by slashes and backslashes in an `n x n` grid.

## Problem Statement

Given an `n x n` grid composed of `1 x 1` squares where each `1 x 1` square consists of '/', '\', or blank space ' ', determine the number of contiguous regions in the grid.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

grid = [" /", "/ "]


Output:
2
Example 2:

Input:
grid = [" /", "  "]
Output:
1
Example 3:

Input:
grid = ["/\\", "\\/"]
Output:
5
Constraints
n == grid.length == grid[i].length
1 <= n <= 30
grid[i][j] is either '/', '\', or ' '.
Solution Explanation

The solution uses a Disjoint Set (Union-Find) data structure to manage and merge regions. Each cell in the grid is considered to have up to 4 potential connections (top, right, bottom, and left). The code handles the merging of regions based on the presence of slashes and backslashes, ensuring that connected regions are correctly identified.

```python
from typing import List

class DisjointSet:
    def __init__(self):
        """
        Unbalanced Disjoint Set (Union-Find) with path compression.
        """
        self.pi = {}

    def union(self, x, y):
        pi_x = self.find(x)
        pi_y = self.find(y)
        self.pi[pi_y] = pi_x

    def find(self, x):
        if x not in self.pi:
            self.pi[x] = x
        if self.pi[x] != x:
            self.pi[x] = self.find(self.pi[x])
        return self.pi[x]

class Solution:
    def regionsBySlashes(self, grid: List[str]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        ds = DisjointSet()
        T, R, B, L = range(4)  
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                e = grid[i][j]
                if e == "/" or e == " ":
                    ds.union((i, j, B), (i, j, R))
                    ds.union((i, j, T), (i, j, L))
                if e == "\\" or e == " ":
                    ds.union((i, j, T), (i, j, R))
                    ds.union((i, j, B), (i, j, L))
                if i - 1 >= 0:
                    ds.union((i, j, T), (i-1, j, B))
                if j - 1 >= 0:
                    ds.union((i, j, L), (i, j-1, R))
        return len(set(ds.find(x) for x in ds.pi.keys()))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    assert Solution().regionsBySlashes([
          " /",
          "/ "
        ]) == 2
    assert Solution().regionsBySlashes([
          "//",
          "/ "
        ]) == 3
```
