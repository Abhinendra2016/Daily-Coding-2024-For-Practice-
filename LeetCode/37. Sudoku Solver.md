# Problem: Sudoku Solver

Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells. A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

1. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
2. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
3. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.
4. The '.' character indicates empty cells.

## Solution

```python
from typing import List
import string

class Solution:
    def solveSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        def getValidDigits(row, col):
            valid = set(string.digits[1:])
            for i in range(9):
                valid.discard(board[row][i])
                valid.discard(board[i][col])
                valid.discard(board[3 * (row // 3) + i // 3][3 * (col // 3) + i % 3])
            return valid
        
        def solve(s: int) -> bool:
            if s == 81:
                return True
            
            i, j = indices[s]
            
            if board[i][j] != '.':
                return solve(s + 1)
            
            valid_digits = getValidDigits(i, j)
            for c in valid_digits:
                board[i][j] = c
                if solve(s + 1):
                    return True
                board[i][j] = '.'
            
            return False
        
        indices = [(i, j) for i in range(9) for j in range(9)]
        solve(0)
```
<h2>Explanation</h2>

The solveSudoku function takes a 9x9 Sudoku board represented as a 2D list of characters and solves it in-place.<br>
The getValidDigits function returns a set of valid digits that can be placed at a given cell (row, col) without violating the Sudoku rules.<br>
The solve function is a recursive backtracking algorithm that tries to fill in each empty cell with a valid digit. It starts with cell (0, 0) and proceeds row by row.<br>
If a cell is not empty, the algorithm moves to the next cell. If all cells are filled (i.e., s == 81), it returns True to indicate success.<br>
If a cell is empty, it tries all valid digits at that cell, recursively filling in the rest of the board. If a valid digit leads to a solution, it returns True. Otherwise, it backtracks and tries the next valid digit.<br>
The indices list stores the indices of all cells in the board, which helps in iterating over the board in a linear fashion.
