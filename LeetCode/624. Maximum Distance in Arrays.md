# Problem 624: Maximum Distance in Arrays

You are given `m` arrays, where each array is sorted in ascending order.

You can pick up two integers from two different arrays (each array picks one) and calculate the distance. The distance between two integers `a` and `b` is defined as their absolute difference `|a - b|`.

Return the maximum distance.

## Problem Description

### Example 1:
- **Input:** `arrays = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [1, 2, 3]]`
- **Output:** `4`
- **Explanation:** One way to reach the maximum distance of `4` is to pick `1` in the first or third array and pick `5` in the second array.

### Example 2:
- **Input:** `arrays = [[1], [1]]`
- **Output:** `0`

### Constraints:
- `m == arrays.length`
- `2 <= m <= 10^5`
- `1 <= arrays[i].length <= 500`
- `-10^4 <= arrays[i][j] <= 10^4`
- `arrays[i]` is sorted in ascending order.
- There will be at most `10^5` integers in all the arrays.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDistance(self, arrays: list[list[int]]) -> int:
        ans = 0
        mn = 10000
        mx = -10000

        for A in arrays:
            ans = max(ans, A[-1] - mn, mx - A[0])
            mn = min(mn, A[0])
            mx = max(mx, A[-1])

        return ans
```
<h2>Time Complexity</h2>

The time complexity of this solution is O(m), where m is the number of arrays. This is because we iterate through each array once.<br>

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>

The space complexity of this solution is O(1), as no additional space proportional to the input size is used.<br>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

This solution keeps track of the minimum and maximum values seen so far as it iterates through each array. For each array, it calculates the possible maximum distance by either subtracting the current array's first element from the maximum seen so far or subtracting the minimum seen so far from the current array's last element. The solution then updates the global maximum distance accordingly.<br>
