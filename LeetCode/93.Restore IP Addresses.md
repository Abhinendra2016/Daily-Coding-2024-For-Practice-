# Problem 93: Restore IP Addresses

A valid IP address consists of exactly four integers separated by single dots. Each integer is between 0 and 255 (inclusive) and cannot have leading zeros.

For example, "0.1.2.201" and "192.168.1.1" are valid IP addresses, but "0.011.255.245", "192.168.1.312" and "192.168@1.1" are invalid IP addresses.

Given a string s containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting dots into s. You are not allowed to reorder or remove any digits in s. You may return the valid IP addresses in any order.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def restoreIpAddresses(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        def dfs(start: int, path: List[str], count: int) -> None:
            if count > 4:
                return
            if count == 4 and start == len(s):
                ans.append(".".join(path))
                return
            for length in range(1, min(4, len(s) - start + 1)):
                num = s[start:start + length]
                if (length > 1 and s[start] == '0') or int(num) > 255:
                    break
                dfs(start + length, path + [num], count + 1)

        ans = []
        dfs(0, [], 0)
        return ans
```
<h2>Time Complexity</h2>

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) in the best case and O(3^4) in the worst case, as there are at most 3 choices for each of the 4 parts of the IP address.

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>

The space complexity of this solution is O(1) in the best case and O(3^4) in the worst case, as the number of recursive calls can go up to 3^4.

<h2>Explanation</h2>
=>We use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to generate all possible valid IP addresses.<br>
=>The dfs function takes three arguments: the current index in the string s, a list path containing the parts of the IP address being constructed, and a count of the number of parts added so far.<br>
=>If we have added 4 parts and reached the end of the string, we add the current path as a valid IP address to the ans list.<br>
Otherwise, we try adding 1, 2, or 3 digits as the next part of the IP address, ensuring that the part is not longer than 3 digits, does not have leading zeros (unless it is 0), and is less than or equal to 255.<br>
=> continue this process recursively until we have constructed a valid IP address or determined that it is impossible to do so.
