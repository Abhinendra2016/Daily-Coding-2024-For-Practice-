# Problem 1438.Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit

This document describes the solution for finding the longest continuous subarray in an array nums where the absolute difference between any two elements is less than or equal to a given limit limit.

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers nums and an integer limit, return the size of the longest non-empty subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to limit.

## Examples

Example 1:

Input : 
nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest subarray satisfying the condition is [2, 4].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [10,1,2,4,7,2], limit = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest subarray satisfying the condition is [2, 4, 7, 2].
Example 3:

Input: nums = [4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2], limit = 0
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest subarray satisfying the condition is any subarray of size 3 consisting only of the number 2.

## Constraints
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
0 <= limit <= 10^9

The solution utilizes two double-ended queues (deques):

min_queue: Stores elements in ascending order.
max_queue: Stores elements in descending order.
We maintain a sliding window using two pointers left and right. The algorithm iterates through the array, adding elements to both queues while keeping them sorted. If the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the window exceeds the limit, we shrink the window from the left side by removing elements from the queues and incrementing left. We keep track of the maximum window size encountered and return it at the end.

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
  def longestSubarray(self, nums, limit):
    ans = 1
    min_queue = collections.deque()
    max_queue = collections.deque()
    left, right = 0, 0

    while right < len(nums):
      # Add element to queues while maintaining order
      while min_queue and nums[right] < min_queue[-1]:
        min_queue.pop()
      min_queue.append(nums[right])

      while max_queue and nums[right] > max_queue[-1]:
        max_queue.pop()
      max_queue.append(nums[right])

      # Shrink window while violation occurs
      while (max_queue and min_queue) and max_queue[0] - min_queue[0] > limit:
        if nums[left] == min_queue[0]:
          min_queue.popleft()
        if nums[left] == max_queue[0]:
          max_queue.popleft()
        left += 1

      # Update max length
      ans = max(ans, right - left + 1)

      right += 1

    return ans
```
