# 2181. Merge Nodes in Between Zeros

## Problem Description

You are given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers separated by 0's. The beginning and end of the linked list will have `Node.val == 0`.

For every two consecutive 0's, merge all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any 0's.

Return the head of the modified linked list.

## Solution

The solution involves traversing the linked list and summing the values of nodes between two consecutive zeros. When a zero is encountered, a new node is created with the accumulated sum and added to the result list. The following Python class implements this logic:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        current = dummy
        temp_sum = 0       
        while head:
            if head.val == 0:
                if temp_sum != 0:
                    current.next = ListNode(temp_sum)
                    current = current.next
                    temp_sum = 0
            else:
                temp_sum += head.val
            head = head.next
        return dummy.next
```
