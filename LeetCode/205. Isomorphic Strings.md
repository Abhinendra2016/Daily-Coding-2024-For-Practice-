# Problem 205: Isomorphic Strings

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
  def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    return [*map(s.index, s)] == [*map(t.index, t)]
```

<h2>Time Complexity</h2>

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the strings s and t. The map function is used to map each character in the strings to its index, and then the lists of indices are compared.

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>

The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the strings s and t. This is because the map function creates lists of indices that are the same length as the input strings.

<h2>Explanation</h2>
=>I use the map function to map each character in the strings s and t to its index in the string.<br>
=>I convert the resulting iterators to lists using [*...] and compare the lists to check if the characters in s can be<br> replaced to get t.<br>
=>If the lists are equal, the strings are isomorphic; otherwise, they are not
