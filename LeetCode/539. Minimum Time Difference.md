# Problem 539 : Minimum Time Difference

Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "HH:MM" format, return the minimum minutes difference between any two time-points in the list.

### Example 1:
- **Input**: `timePoints = ["23:59","00:00"]`
- **Output**: `1`

### Example 2:
- **Input**: `timePoints = ["00:00","23:59","00:00"]`
- **Output**: `0`

### Constraints:
- `2 <= timePoints.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `timePoints[i]` is in the format "HH:MM".

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
  def findMinDifference(self, timePoints: list[str]) -> int:
    ans = 24 * 60
    nums = sorted([int(timePoint[:2]) * 60 + int(timePoint[3:])
                   for timePoint in timePoints])
    for a, b in zip(nums, nums[1:]):
      ans = min(ans, b - a)
    return min(ans, 24 * 60 - nums[-1] + nums[0])
```
<h2>Time Complexity</h2>

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the number of time points. Sorting the list takes O(n log n) time, and iterating through the sorted list takes O(n).<br>

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>

The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of time points. This is because a list of length n is used to store the time points converted into minutes.<br>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

The solution works by converting all time points from "HH
" format to minutes since midnight (e.g., "23:59" becomes 1439 and "00:00" becomes 0). Then the list of time points is sorted.<br>

The minimum time difference is found by comparing each adjacent pair of time points in the sorted list. To account for the circular nature of the clock, we also check the difference between the last time point of the day and the first time point of the next day.<br>
