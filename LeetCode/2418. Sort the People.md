# 2418. Sort the People

## Problem Description

You are given an array of strings `names`, and an array `heights` that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length `n`.

For each index `i`, `names[i]` and `heights[i]` denote the name and height of the `i-th` person.

Return `names` sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

## Examples

### Example 1

Input: names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]
Output: ["Mary","Emma","John"]
Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.

### Example 2
Input: names = ["Alice","Bob","Bob"], heights = [155,185,150]
Output: ["Bob","Alice","Bob"]
Explanation: The first Bob is the tallest, followed by Alice and the second Bob.

### Constraints

n == names.length == heights.length
1 <= n <= 10^3
1 <= names[i].length <= 20
1 <= heights[i] <= 10^5
names[i] consists of lower and upper case English letters.
All the values of heights are distinct.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def sortPeople(self, names: List[str], heights: List[int]) -> List[str]:
        # Combine names and heights into a list of tuples
        combined = list(zip(heights, names))
        
        # Sort the combined list by heights in descending order
        combined.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[0])
        
        # Extract the names from the sorted combined list
        sorted_names = [name for height, name in combined]
        
        return sorted_names

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
print(solution.sortPeople(["Mary", "John", "Emma"], [180, 165, 170]))  # Output: ["Mary", "Emma", "John"]
print(solution.sortPeople(["Alice", "Bob", "Bob"], [155, 185, 150]))  # Output: ["Bob", "Alice", "Bob"]
```
