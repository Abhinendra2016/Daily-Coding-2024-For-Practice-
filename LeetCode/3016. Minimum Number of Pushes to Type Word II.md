## 3016 Minimum Number of Pushes to Type Word II

You are given a string `word` containing lowercase English letters. Telephone keypads have keys mapped with distinct collections of lowercase English letters, which can be used to form words by pushing them. For example, the key 2 is mapped with ["a","b","c"], where you need to push the key one time to type "a", two times to type "b", and three times to type "c".
<br>
It is allowed to remap the keys numbered 2 to 9 to distinct collections of letters. The keys can be remapped to any amount of letters, but each letter must be mapped to exactly one key. Your task is to find the minimum number of times the keys will be pushed to type the string `word` after remapping the keys.

#### Example 1

**Input:** `word = "abcde"`
**Output:** `5`
**Explanation:** The remapped keypad provides the minimum cost. Each letter is mapped to a different key with a single push. Total cost is `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`.

#### Example 2

**Input:** `word = "xyzxyzxyzxyz"`
**Output:** `12`
**Explanation:** The remapped keypad provides the minimum cost. Each letter is mapped to a different key with one push. Total cost is `1 * 4 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 4 = 12`.

#### Example 3

**Input:** `word = "aabbccddeeffgghhiiiiii"`
**Output:** `24`
**Explanation:** The remapped keypad provides the minimum cost. Some letters are mapped to the same key with multiple pushes. Total cost is `24`.

## Constraints

- `1 <= word.length <= 105`
- `word` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```python
import collections

class Solution:
    def minimumPushes(self, word: str) -> int:
        freqs = sorted(collections.Counter(word).values(), reverse=True)
        return sum(freq * (i // 8 + 1) for i, freq in enumerate(freqs))
```
<h2>Explanation</h2>

The solution uses a frequency counter to determine how often each letter appears in the input string. The frequencies are sorted in descending order. For each frequency, it calculates the number of pushes required based on the key position. Specifically, each key can accommodate up to 8 letters, and thus the number of pushes required increases with the number of letters beyond this limit.
