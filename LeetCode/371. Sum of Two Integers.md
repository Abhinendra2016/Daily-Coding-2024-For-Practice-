# Problem 371: Sum of Two Integers

Given two integers a and b, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators + and -.

## Example 1:

**Input:** a = 1, b = 2  
**Output:** 3

## Example 2:

**Input:** a = 2, b = 3  
**Output:** 5

## Constraints:

- -1000 <= a, b <= 1000

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def getSum(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        mask = 0xFFFFFFFF
        kMax = 2000

        while b != 0:
            a, b = (a ^ b) & mask, ((a & b) << 1) & mask

        return a if a < kMax else ~(a ^ mask)
```

<h2>Time Complexity</h2>
The time complexity of this solution is O(1) in average case due to a fixed number of operations for standard integer sizes.<br>
<h2>Space Complexity</h2>
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of extra space.<br>
<h2>Explanation</h2>
The solution uses bitwise operations to compute the sum of two integers without using the + or - operators:<br>
- `a ^ b` computes the sum of `a` and `b` without carrying.<br>
- `(a & b) << 1` computes the carry bits.<br>
- The loop continues until there are no carry bits left.<br>
- The mask `0xFFFFFFFF` ensures that the result fits within a 32-bit integer.<br>
- If `a` is negative, we return its two's complement representation by using `~(a ^ mask)`.<br>
