# Problem 191: Number of 1 Bits

Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the number of set bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

## Example 1:

**Input**: n = 11

**Output**: 3

**Explanation**:

The input binary string `1011` has a total of three set bits.

## Example 2:

**Input**: n = 128

**Output**: 1

**Explanation**:

The input binary string `10000000` has a total of one set bit.

## Example 3:

**Input**: n = 2147483645

**Output**: 30

**Explanation**:

The input binary string `1111111111111111111111111111101` has a total of thirty set bits.

## Constraints:

1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        ans = 0

        for i in range(32):
            if (n >> i) & 1:
                ans += 1

        return ans
```
<h2>Time Complexity</h2>

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because the loop runs for a fixed number of 32 iterations regardless of the input size.<br>

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>

The space complexity of this solution is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of extra space.<br>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

The solution uses a loop to iterate through each of the 32 bits of the integer n. By shifting n to the right i times and <br>checking the least significant bit, we determine if each bit is set. If the bit is set (i.e., it is 1), we increment the <br>ans counter. The result is the total number of set bits in the binary representation of n.<br>
