# Problem 1636: Sort Array by Increasing Frequency

Given an array of integers `nums`, sort the array in increasing order based on the frequency of the values. If multiple values have the same frequency, sort them in decreasing order.

Return the sorted array.

## Examples

### Example 1
- **Input:** `nums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3]`
- **Output:** `[3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`
- **Explanation:** '3' has a frequency of 1, '1' has a frequency of 2, and '2' has a frequency of 3.

### Example 2
- **Input:** `nums = [2, 3, 1, 3, 2]`
- **Output:** `[1, 3, 3, 2, 2]`
- **Explanation:** '2' and '3' both have a frequency of 2, so they are sorted in decreasing order.

### Example 3
- **Input:** `nums = [-1, 1, -6, 4, 5, -6, 1, 4, 1]`
- **Output:** `[5, -1, 4, 4, -6, -6, 1, 1, 1]`

## Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Solution

```python
class T:
  def __init__(self, num: int, freq: int):
    self.num = num
    self.freq = freq

  def __lt__(self, other):
    if self.freq == other.freq:
      return self.num > other.num
    return self.freq < other.freq


class Solution:
  def frequencySort(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    ans = []
    heap = []

    for num, freq in collections.Counter(nums).items():
      heapq.heappush(heap, T(num, freq))

    while len(heap) > 0:
      num = heap[0].num
      freq = heapq.heappop(heap).freq
      ans.extend([num] * freq)

    return ans
```
<h2>Explanation</h2>

We define a class T to represent an element with its frequency. The __lt__ method ensures that the heap will sort the elements first by frequency (increasing) and then by value (decreasing) if frequencies are equal.

In the Solution class, the frequencySort method uses a heap to sort the elements based on the custom comparator defined in the T class.

We count the frequency of each element in the array using collections.Counter.

We push each element and its frequency into the heap.

We pop elements from the heap and extend the result list ans by adding each element the number of times it appears (its frequency).

Finally, we return the sorted array.

<h2>Time Complexity</h2>

The time complexity is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is due to the heap operations and the iteration over the elements.

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>

The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of the frequency count and the heap.
