# Problem: Merge Sorted Array

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function but instead be stored inside the array `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

## Example

Input: `nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3`
Output: `[1,2,2,3,5,6]`
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are `[1,2,3]` and `[2,5,6]`. The result of the merge is `[1,2,2,3,5,6]` with the underlined elements coming from `nums1`.

Input: `nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0`
Output: `[1]`
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are `[1]` and `[]`. The result of the merge is `[1]`.

Input: `nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1`
Output: `[1]`
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are `[]` and `[1]`. The result of the merge is `[1]`. Note that because `m = 0`, there are no elements in `nums1`. The `0` is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in `nums1`.

## Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        i = m - 1  # nums1's index (the actual nums)
        j = n - 1  # nums2's index
        k = m + n - 1  # nums1's index (the next filled position)
        while j >= 0:
            if i >= 0 and nums1[i] > nums2[j]:
                nums1[k] = nums1[i]
                k -= 1
                i -= 1
            else:
                nums1[k] = nums2[j]
                k -= 1
                j -= 1
```
<H2>Explanation</H2>

We start from the end of both arrays nums1 and nums2, which are sorted in non-decreasing order.<BR>
We compare the last elements of both arrays (nums1[i] and nums2[j]) and place the larger one at the end of nums1.<BR>
We continue this process until we have exhausted all elements in nums2.<BR>
Finally, nums1 will contain the merged sorted array with all elements from nums2 inserted in the correct positions.<BR>
