# Problem: Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.

A mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

Example:

Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

## Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def letterCombinations(self, digits: str) -> List[str]:
        if not digits:
            return []
        digitToLetters = ['', '', 'abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'jkl', 'mno', 'pqrs', 'tuv', 'wxyz']
        ans = ['']
        for digit in digits:
            new_ans = []
            for prefix in ans:
                for letter in digitToLetters[int(digit)]:
                    new_ans.append(prefix + letter)
            ans = new_ans
        return ans
```
<h2>Time Complexity</h2>

The time complexity of this solution is O(3^N * 4^M), where N is the number of digits that map to 3 letters (e.g., 2, 3, 4,<br> 5, 6, 8) and M is the number of digits that map to 4 letters (e.g., 7, 9). This is because for each digit that maps to 3 letters, we have 3 possibilities, and for each digit that maps to 4 letters, we have 4 possibilities.<br>

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>

The space complexity is O(3^N * 4^M) as well, considering the worst-case scenario where each digit maps to 3 or 4 letters.<br>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

We initialize ans with an empty string.<br>
For each digit in the input digits, we iterate through the existing combinations in ans and append all possible <br>combinations of the current digit's letters to each existing combination.<br>
We update ans with the new combinations for each digit.<br>
Finally, we return the list of all combinations in ans.<br>
