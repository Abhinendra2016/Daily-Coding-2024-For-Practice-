# 238. Product of Array Except Self

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

### Example 1

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]  
Output: [24,12,8,6]

### Example 2

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]  
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

## Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        ans = [1] * n

        # Calculate prefix products and store in ans
        for i in range(1, n):
            ans[i] = ans[i - 1] * nums[i - 1]

        # Calculate suffix products on the fly and multiply with prefix products
        suffix = 1
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            ans[i] *= suffix
            suffix *= nums[i]

        return ans
```

<h2>Explanation</h2>

Prefix Product Calculation: We iterate through the array and calculate the product of all elements before each index. This product is stored in the ans array.<br>
Suffix Product Calculation and Combination: We iterate through the array in reverse order and calculate the product of all elements after each index. This product is multiplied with the previously stored prefix product in the ans array.<br>

<h2>Time Complexity</h2>
O(n): We iterate through the array twice, once for prefix product calculation and once for suffix product calculation.<br>

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>

O(1): The output array ans does not count towards extra space as per the problem constraints. Only a few extra variables are used, hence O(1) space complexity.<br>
