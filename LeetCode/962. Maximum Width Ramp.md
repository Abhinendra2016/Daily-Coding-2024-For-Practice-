# Problem 962: Maximum Width Ramp

A ramp in an integer array `nums` is a pair `(i, j)` for which `i < j` and `nums[i] <= nums[j]`. The width of such a ramp is `j - i`.

Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum width of a ramp in `nums`. If there is no ramp in `nums`, return `0`.

## Example 1:

Input: nums = [6, 0, 8, 2, 1, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum width ramp is achieved at (i, j) = (1, 5): nums[1] = 0 and nums[5] = 5.
## Example 2:
Input: nums = [9, 8, 1, 0, 1, 9, 4, 0, 4, 1]
Output: 7
Explanation: The maximum width ramp is achieved at (i, j) = (2, 9): nums[2] = 1 and nums[9] = 1.
Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 50,000
0 <= nums[i] <= 50,000

```python
class Solution:
  def maxWidthRamp(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
    ans = 0
    stack = []
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
      if stack == [] or num <= nums[stack[-1]]:
        stack.append(i)
    for i, num in reversed(list(enumerate(nums))):
      while stack and num >= nums[stack[-1]]:
        ans = max(ans, i - stack.pop())
    return ans
```
<h2>Time Complexity</h2>

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array nums. This is because each element of the array is processed at most twice: once when it is pushed onto the stack and once when it is popped off.

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>

The space complexity is O(n) as well, due to the space used by the stack to store the indices of the elements in the array.

<h2>Explanation</h2>

The solution uses a stack to keep track of indices of the array nums in decreasing order. First, we traverse the array and push indices onto the stack if their corresponding values in nums are smaller than or equal to the current top value of the stack.
