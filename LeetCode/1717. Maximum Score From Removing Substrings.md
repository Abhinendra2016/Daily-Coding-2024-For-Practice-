# 1717 Maximum Score From Removing Substrings

## Problem Description

You are given a string `s` and two integers `x` and `y`. You can perform two types of operations any number of times:

1. Remove substring "ab" and gain `x` points.
2. Remove substring "ba" and gain `y` points.

You need to return the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on `s`.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
Input: s = "cdbcbbaaabab", x = 4, y = 5
Output: 19
Explanation:

Remove the "ba" in "cdbcbbaaabab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaaab" and 5 points are added to the score.
Remove the "ab" in "cdbcbbaaab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaa" and 4 points are added to the score.
Remove the "ba" in "cdbcbbaa". Now, s = "cdbcba" and 5 points are added to the score.
Remove the "ba" in "cdbcba". Now, s = "cdbc" and 5 points are added to the score.
Total score = 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 19.


**Example 2:**
Input: s = "aabbaaxybbaabb", x = 5, y = 4
Output: 20


### Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `1 <= x, y <= 104`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

The solution involves two main steps:

1. Prioritize the removal of the substring with the higher points.
2. Remove the other substring afterward to maximize the points.

### Algorithm

1. Check which of the two operations yields more points and prioritize that one.
2. Use a stack to remove instances of the prioritized substring and accumulate points.
3. After processing the first substring, use another stack to process the remaining string for the second substring and accumulate points.

### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumGain(self, s: str, x: int, y: int) -> int:
        if x > y:
            return self._gain(s, 'ab', x, 'ba', y)
        else:
            return self._gain(s, 'ba', y, 'ab', x)

    def _gain(self, s: str, sub1: str, point1: int, sub2: str, point2: int) -> int:
        points = 0
        stack = []
        for c in s:
            if stack and stack[-1] == sub1[0] and c == sub1[1]:
                stack.pop()
                points += point1
            else:
                stack.append(c)

        # Create a new stack to remove sub2 and calculate the points
        new_stack = []
        for c in stack:
            if new_stack and new_stack[-1] == sub2[0] and c == sub2[1]:
                new_stack.pop()
                points += point2
            else:
                new_stack.append(c)

        return points
```
