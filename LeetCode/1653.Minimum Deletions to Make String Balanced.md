# Problem 1653: Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced

You are given a string `s` consisting only of characters `'a'` and `'b'`. You can delete any number of characters in `s` to make `s` balanced. A string is balanced if there is no pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `s[i] = 'b'` and `s[j] = 'a'`.

Return the minimum number of deletions needed to make `s` balanced.

### Examples

#### Example 1:

- **Input:** `s = "aababbab"`
- **Output:** `2`
- **Explanation:**
  - You can either delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 2 and 6 (`"aababbab"` -> `"aaabbb"`), or
  - Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 3 and 6 (`"aababbab"` -> `"aabbbb"`).

#### Example 2:

- **Input:** `s = "bbaaaaabb"`
- **Output:** `2`
- **Explanation:** The only solution is to delete the first two characters.

### Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s[i]` is `'a'` or `'b'`.

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to traverse the string and maintain the minimum number of deletions required to make the string balanced up to the current character. We also keep track of the number of `'b'` characters encountered so far.

### Python Code

```python
class Solution:
  def minimumDeletions(self, s: str) -> int:
    dp = 0  # minimum number of deletions needed
    countB = 0  # number of 'b' characters encountered

    for c in s:
      if c == 'a':
        dp = min(dp + 1, countB)  # either delete 'a' or convert all previous 'b' to 'a'
      else:
        countB += 1  # increment count of 'b'

    return dp
```

### Explanation

Initialize dp to 0, which represents the minimum number of deletions needed.<br>
Initialize countB to 0, which keeps track of the number of 'b' characters encountered so far.<br>
Iterate through each character c in the string s:<br>
If c is 'a', update dp to be the minimum of dp + 1 (delete the current 'a') or countB (delete all previous 'b' characters).<br>
If c is 'b', increment the countB.<br>
Return the value of dp, which represents the minimum deletions required to make the string balanced.<br>
