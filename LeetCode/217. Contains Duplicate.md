# Contains Duplicate

## Problem Description

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

Input: `nums = [1,2,3,1]`  
Output: `true`

**Example 2:**

Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4]`  
Output: `false`

**Example 3:**

Input: `nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]`  
Output: `true`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        return len(nums) != len(set(nums))
```
<h2>Time Complexity</h2>

<h2>The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the nums array. This is because converting nums to a set and checking its length are both O(n) operations.<br>

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>

The space complexity of this solution is O(n) as well. This is because the set created from nums will store at most n elements.<br>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

The solution uses a set to check for duplicate elements in the nums array. If the length of the array is not equal to the length of the set of the array, it means there are duplicate elements, and the function returns True, indicating that the array contains duplicates. Otherwise, it returns False.
