# Problem 58: Length of Last Word

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

## Example

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        words = s.split()
        return len(words[-1]) if words else 0
```
<h2>Time Complexity</h2>

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s. This is because the split method has a time complexity of O(n) and we then access the last element of the resulting list.

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>

The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s. This is because the split method creates a list of words, which may have up to n elements in the worst case.

<h2>Explanation</h2>

We split the input string s into words using the split method, which splits the string on whitespace by default.<br>
If the input string is empty or consists only of whitespace, the split method will return an empty list, so we return 0 in this case.<br>
Otherwise, we return the length of the last word in the list of words, which is accessed using the index -1.
