# Problem: Clone Graph

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=0, neighbors=None):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []

from typing import Optional
class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not node:
            return None

        q = collections.deque([node])
        map = {node: Node(node.val)}

        while q:
            u = q.popleft()
            for v in u.neighbors:
                if v not in map:
                    map[v] = Node(v.val)
                    q.append(v)
                map[u].neighbors.append(map[v])

        return map[node]
```
<h2>Time Complexity</h2>

The time complexity of this solution is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) in the graph and E is the number of edges. This is because we visit each node and each edge exactly once during the breadth-first traversal.

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>

The space complexity of this solution is O(V), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) in the graph. This is because we use a queue to perform the breadth-first traversal, and the queue can contain at most V nodes.

<h2>Explanation</h2>
We perform a breadth-first traversal of the original graph, creating a new node for each encountered node and maintaining a mapping of original nodes to new nodes.<br>
For each neighbor of a node, if the neighbor has not been visited yet, we create a new node for it and add it to the queue for further processing.<br>
Finally, we return the clone of the given node.
