# Problem 1110: Delete Nodes And Return Forest

Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.

After deleting all nodes with a value in `to_delete`, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).

Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest. You may return the result in any order.

## Example 1

**Input:**
root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
**Output:**
[[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]

## Example 2

**Input:**
root = [1,2,4,null,3], to_delete = [3]


**Output:**
[[1,2,4]]


## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the given tree is at most 1000.
- Each node has a distinct value between 1 and 1000.
- `to_delete.length <= 1000`
- `to_delete` contains distinct values between 1 and 1000.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def delNodes(self, root: TreeNode, to_delete: List[int]) -> List[TreeNode]:
        toDeleteSet = set(to_delete)
        ans = []

        def dfs(node, isRoot):
            if not node:
                return None
            deleted = node.val in toDeleteSet
            if isRoot and not deleted:
                ans.append(node)
            node.left = dfs(node.left, deleted)
            node.right = dfs(node.right, deleted)
            return None if deleted else node

        dfs(root, True)
        return ans
```
<h2>Explanation</h2>

This solution uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to traverse the binary tree and handle node deletions. The algorithm follows these steps:<br>

<h2>Initialization:</h2>

Convert the to_delete list into a set for O(1) average-time complexity checks.<br>
Create an empty list ans to store the roots of the trees in the remaining forest.<br>

DFS Traversal:<br>

Define a helper function dfs that takes a node and a boolean isRoot indicating if the node is a root of a tree.
If the node is None, return None.<br>
Check if the current node needs to be deleted by checking if its value is in the to_delete set.
If the node is a root and is not deleted, add it to the ans list.<br>
Recursively call dfs on the left and right children of the current node. Pass True for isRoot if the current node is deleted, otherwise pass False.<br>
Return None if the current node is deleted, otherwise return the current node.

<h2>Result:</h2>

Call dfs starting from the root node, with isRoot set to True.<br>
Return the ans list, which contains the roots of the trees in the remaining forest.<br>

<h2>Time Complexity</h2>

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once during the DFS traversal.<br>

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>

The space complexity is O(n) due to the recursive call stack in the DFS traversal and the additional space used by the to_delete set and the ans list.<br>
