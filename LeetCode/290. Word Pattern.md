# Problem: Word Pattern

Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s.

## Example

Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true

Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false

Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def wordPattern(self, pattern: str, s: str) -> bool:
        t = s.split()
        return [*map(pattern.index, pattern)] == [*map(t.index, t)]
```
<h2>Time Complexity</h2>

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of characters in the input string s. This is because we need to split s into a list of words and generate the lists of indices.<br>

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>

The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of characters in the input string s. This is because we need to store the list of words t and the lists of indices.<br>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

We split the input string s into a list of words t.<br>
We then use list comprehension with map and index to generate a list of indices for each character in the pattern and each word in t.<br>
If the two lists of indices are the same, then there is a bijection between the pattern and the words in t, and we return True; otherwise, we return False.<br>
