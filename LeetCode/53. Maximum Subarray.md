# Problem 53: Maximum Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

## Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`  
**Output:** `6`  
**Explanation:** The subarray `[4,-1,2,1]` has the largest sum `6`.

## Example 2:

**Input:** `nums = [1]`  
**Output:** `1`  
**Explanation:** The subarray `[1]` has the largest sum `1`.

## Example 3:

**Input:** `nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]`  
**Output:** `23`  
**Explanation:** The subarray `[5,4,-1,7,8]` has the largest sum `23`.

## Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        max_sum = nums[0]
        current_sum = nums[0]

        for num in nums[1:]:
            current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)

        return max_sum
```
# Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array nums. This is because the algorithm iterates through each element in nums once.<br>

# Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(1), meaning that the space required by the algorithm remains constant regardless of the size of the input array nums. This is because the algorithm uses only a fixed amount of additional space to store the maximum sum and current sum variables.<br>

# Explanation
I uses a simple algorithm that iterates through the input array once, keeping track of the maximum sum of subarrays seen so far. It uses two variables, max_sum and current_sum, to store the maximum sum of subarrays ending at the current element and the maximum sum of subarrays seen so far, respectively.<br>
