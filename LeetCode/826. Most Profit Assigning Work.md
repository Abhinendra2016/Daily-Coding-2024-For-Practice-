# 826. Most Profit Assigning Work

You have `n` jobs and `m` workers. You are given three arrays: `difficulty`, `profit`, and `worker` where:

- `difficulty[i]` and `profit[i]` are the difficulty and the profit of the ith job, and
- `worker[j]` is the ability of jth worker (i.e., the jth worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most `worker[j]`).

Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.

For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is $0.
Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.

## Example 1:

**Input**: 
difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10],
profit = [10,20,30,40,50],
worker = [4,5,6,7]

**Output**: 
100

**Explanation**: Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get a profit of [20,20,30,30] separately.

## Example 2:

**Input**: 

difficulty = [85,47,57],
profit = [24,66,99],
worker = [40,25,25]

**Output**: 

0

## Constraints:

- `n == difficulty.length`
- `n == profit.length`
- `m == worker.length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 10^4`
- `1 <= difficulty[i], profit[i], worker[i] <= 10^5`

## Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxProfitAssignment(self, difficulty: List[int], profit: List[int], worker: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize total profit
        ans = 0
        
        # Create a sorted list of jobs based on difficulty
        jobs = sorted(zip(difficulty, profit))
        
        # Sort workers by their ability
        worker.sort(reverse=True)

        # Initialize variables to track job index and maximum profit seen so far
        i = 0
        maxProfit = 0

        # Iterate over each worker sorted by ability
        for w in sorted(worker):
            # Update maxProfit to the highest profit for jobs that the worker can perform
            while i < len(jobs) and w >= jobs[i][0]:
                maxProfit = max(maxProfit, jobs[i][1])
                i += 1
            # Add the best profit achievable by the current worker to the total profit
            ans += maxProfit

        return ans
```
