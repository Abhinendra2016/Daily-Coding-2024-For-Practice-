## 242.Valid Anagram

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

Input: `s = "anagram"`, `t = "nagaram"`  
Output: `true`

**Example 2:**

Input: `s = "rat"`, `t = "car"`  
Output: `false`

## Solution

```python
import collections

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False

        count = collections.Counter(s)
        count.subtract(collections.Counter(t))
        return all(freq == 0 for freq in count.values())
```
<h2>Time Complexity</h2>
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the strings's and t'. This is because creating a "Counter' from the strings and subtracting one "Counter' from another both take O(n) time.<br>

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) in terms of additional space used by the algorithm (excluding the space <br>required to store the input strings). This is because the "Counter' object will at most store 26 different characters (for lowercase English letters), which is a constant space.<br>
<h2>Explanation</h2>
1. Length Check: First, the solution checks if the lengths of 's' and 't are equal. If they are not,
"t cannot be an anagram of s', so the function returns 'False*.<br>
2. Counting Characters: The solution uses collections.Counter' to count the frequency of each character ins and t.<br>
3. Subtracting Counters: The subtract method is used to subtract the counts of characters in
"t from the counts in's'.<br>
4. Checking Frequencies: Finally, the solution checks if all frequencies in the resulting 'Counter' are zero, which would mean that t' is an anagram of 's'.<br>
