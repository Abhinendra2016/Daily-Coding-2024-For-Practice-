# Problem 846: Hand of Straights

Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size `groupSize`, and consists of `groupSize` consecutive cards.<BR>

Given an integer array `hand` where `hand[i]` is the value written on the `i`th card and an integer `groupSize`, return `true` if she can rearrange the cards, or `false` otherwise.<BR>

## Example 1:
**Input:** hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:** Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3], [2,3,4], [6,7,8]

## Example 2:
**Input:** hand = [1,2,3,4,5], groupSize = 4  
**Output:** false  
**Explanation:** Alice's hand cannot be rearranged into groups of 4.

## Constraints:
- 1 <= hand.length <= 10^4
- 0 <= hand[i] <= 10^9
- 1 <= groupSize <= hand.length

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
  def isNStraightHand(self, hand: List[int], groupSize: int) -> bool:
    count = collections.Counter(hand)

    for start in sorted(count):
      value = count[start]
      if value > 0:
        for i in range(start, start + groupSize):
          count[i] -= value
          if count[i] < 0:
            return False

    return True
```
<h2>Time Complexity</h2>
The time complexity of the solution is \(O(N \log N)\), where \(N\) is the length of the hand. This is because sorting the hand takes \(O(N \log N)\) time and the subsequent loop over the elements is \(O(N)\).<BR>
<h2>Space Complexity</h2>
The space complexity is \(O(N)\) due to the use of a counter to store the frequency of each card.<BR>
<h2>Explanation</h2>
The solution uses a greedy approach:
1. Count the frequency of each card using `collections.Counter`.<BR>
2. Sort the keys of the counter to ensure we process the cards in ascending order.<BR>
3. For each card `start` in the sorted keys, if its count is greater than zero, try to form a group starting with this card.<BR>
4. For each card in the group (from `start` to `start + groupSize - 1`), decrease the count by the count of the starting card.<BR>
5. If any card count becomes negative during this process, it means we can't form a valid group, so<BR>
