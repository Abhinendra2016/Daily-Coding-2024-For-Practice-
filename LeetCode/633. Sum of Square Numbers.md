# 633. Sum of Square Numbers

Given a non-negative integer `c`, decide whether there're two integers `a` and `b` such that `a^2 + b^2 = c`.

## Example 1

**Input**: 
c = 5
**Output**: 
true
**Explanation**: 
1 * 1 + 2 * 2 = 5
## Example 2

**Input**: 
c = 3
**Output**: 

## Constraints

- `0 <= c <= 2^31 - 1`

## Solution

```python
from math import isqrt

class Solution:
    def judgeSquareSum(self, c: int) -> bool:
        l, r = 0, isqrt(c)
        
        while l <= r:
            summ = l * l + r * r
            if summ == c:
                return True
            elif summ < c:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1
        
        return False
```
<h2>Explanation</h2>

<h3>Initialization:</h3><br>
We initialize two pointers, l (starting from 0) and r (starting from the integer square root of c).<br>
Two-Pointer Technique:<br>
We use a while loop to check combinations of squares of l and r.<br>
Calculate the sum of the squares of l and r.<br>
If the sum equals c, we return True.<br>
If the sum is less than c, increment l to increase the sum.<br>
If the sum is greater than c, decrement r to decrease the sum.<br>
Termination:<br>
The loop terminates if l exceeds r without finding such a pair, and we return False.
<h2>Time Complexity</h2>

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(sqrt(c)). This is because the two-pointer technique will at most iterate from 0 to sqrt(c), thus making the number of iterations proportional to the square root of c.<br>

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>

The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1). This is because we only use a constant amount of extra space for the variables l, r, and summ.<br>
