# Problem 1894: Find the Student that Will Replace the Chalk

## Problem Description

There are `n` students in a class numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The teacher will give each student a problem starting with student number `0`, then student number `1`, and so on until the teacher reaches student number `n - 1`. After that, the teacher will restart the process, starting with student number `0` again.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `chalk` and an integer `k`. There are initially `k` pieces of chalk. When the student number `i` is given a problem to solve, they will use `chalk[i]` pieces of chalk to solve that problem. However, if the current number of chalk pieces is strictly less than `chalk[i]`, then the student number `i` will be asked to replace the chalk.

Return the index of the student that will replace the chalk pieces.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**

chalk = [5, 1, 5]
k = 22
Output:
0
### Explanation: The students go in turns as follows:

Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 17.
Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 16.
Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 11.
Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 6.
Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 5.
Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 0.
Student number 0 does not have enough chalk, so they will have to replace it.
```python
class Solution:
    def chalkReplacer(self, chalk: list[int], k: int) -> int:
        k %= sum(chalk)  # Reduce k to within the range of total chalk usage
        for i, c in enumerate(chalk):
            k -= c
            if k < 0:
                return i
```
