# Problem 66: Plus One

You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
  def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    for i, d in reversed(list(enumerate(digits))):
      if d < 9:
        digits[i] += 1
        return digits
      digits[i] = 0

    return [1] + digits

```
<h2>Time Complexity</h2>
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of digits in the input array. This is because in the worst case, we may need to iterate through all the digits in the array once.

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>

The space complexity of this solution is O(1), excluding the output array. This is because we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.

<h2>Explanation</h2>

=> This solution iterates through the digits in reverse order, starting from the least significant digit. It checks if each digit is less than 9.<br> 
=> If it is, it increments the digit by 1 and returns the array. If the digit is 9, it sets the digit to 0 and continues to the next digit.<br>
=> If all digits are 9, it adds a 1 at the beginning of the array to handle cases like 999+1.
