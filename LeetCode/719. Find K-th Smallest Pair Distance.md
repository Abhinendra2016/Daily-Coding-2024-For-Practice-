# Find K-th Smallest Pair Distance

The distance of a pair of integers `a` and `b` is defined as the absolute difference between `a` and `b`.

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k`-th smallest distance among all the pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where `0 <= i < j < nums.length`.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**
nums = [1,3,1]
k = 1
**Output:**
0
### Explanation:
Here are all the pairs:
(1, 3) -> Distance: 2
(1, 1) -> Distance: 0
(3, 1) -> Distance: 2
Then the 1st smallest distance pair is (1,1), and its distance is 0.

### Example 2
**Input:**
nums = [1,1,1]
k = 2
**Output:**
5

```python
from typing import List
import bisect
class Solution:
    def smallestDistancePair(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        def numPairDistancesNoGreaterThan(m: int) -> int:
            count = 0
            j = 1
            for i, num in enumerate(nums):
                while j < len(nums) and nums[j] <= num + m:
                    j += 1
                count += j - i - 1
            return count

        return bisect.bisect_left(
            range(0, nums[-1] - nums[0]), k,
            key=lambda m: numPairDistancesNoGreaterThan(m))
```
<h2>Explanation</h2>

Sort the Array: Sorting helps in efficiently counting pairs with distances less than or equal to m.<br>
Binary Search: Use binary search to find the smallest distance where the number of pairs with distance no greater than m is at least k.<br>
Counting Pairs: For each potential distance m, count how many pairs have a distance less than or equal to m using a two-pointer technique.<br>
