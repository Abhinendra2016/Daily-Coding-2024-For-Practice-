# Problem 350: Intersection of Two Arrays II

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order.

## Example 1:
**Input:** nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]  
**Output:** [2,2]

## Example 2:
**Input:** nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]  
**Output:** [4,9]  
**Explanation:** [9,4] is also accepted.

## Constraints:
- 1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000
- 0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000

## Follow up:
1. What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
2. What if `nums1`'s size is small compared to `nums2`'s size? Which algorithm is better?
3. What if elements of `nums2` are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
  def intersect(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    if len(nums1) > len(nums2):
      return self.intersect(nums2, nums1)

    ans = []
    count = collections.Counter(nums1)

    for num in nums2:
      if count[num] > 0:
        ans.append(num)
        count[num] -= 1

    return ans
```
Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n + m), where n is the length of nums1 and m is the length of nums2. This is because we iterate through both arrays once.

Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(min(n, m)) because we store the counts of the smaller array's elements.

Explanation

The solution first checks if nums1 is longer than nums2 and swaps them if necessary to always iterate over the smaller array. This ensures that the space complexity is minimized.
We use a Counter to count the occurrences of each element in nums1.
We then iterate through nums2, and for each element that is also in the Counter, we append it to the result and decrease its count in the Counter.
Finally, we return the result array which contains the intersection of the two arrays.
