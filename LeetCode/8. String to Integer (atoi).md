# Problem 8: String to Integer (atoi)

Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

1. Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").
2. Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity is neither present.
3. Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
4. Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -2^31 should be rounded to -2^31, and integers greater than 2^31 - 1 should be rounded to 2^31 - 1.
5. Return the integer as the final result.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def myAtoi(self, s: str) -> int:
        s = s.lstrip()
        if not s:
            return 0

        sign = -1 if s[0] == '-' else 1
        if s[0] in {'-', '+'}:
            s = s[1:]

        i = 0
        while i < len(s) and s[i].isdigit():
            i += 1

        if i == 0:
            return 0

        num = int(s[:i])
        return max(-2**31, min(sign * num, 2**31 - 1))
```
<h2>Time Complexity</h2>

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s. The algorithm iterates through each character in the string once.

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>

The space complexity of this solution is O(1), as it uses only a constant amount of extra space.

<h2>Explanation</h2>
=>We start by removing any leading whitespace from the input string s.<br>
=>We determine the sign of the integer by checking the first character of the remaining string.<br>
=>We then iterate through the string to find the digits and construct the integer.<br>
=>If no digits are found, we return 0.<br>
Finally, we ensure that the integer is within the 32-bit signed integer range and return it.
