# Problem 1122: Relative Sort Array

Given two arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, the elements of `arr2` are distinct, and all elements in `arr2` are also in `arr1`.

Sort the elements of `arr1` such that the relative ordering of items in `arr1` are the same as in `arr2`. Elements that do not appear in `arr2` should be placed at the end of `arr1` in ascending order.

## Example 1

**Input:**
arr1 = [2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19], arr2 = [2,1,4,3,9,6]

**Output:**

[2,2,2,1,4,3,3,9,6,7,19]

## Example 2

**Input:**
arr1 = [28,6,22,8,44,17], arr2 = [22,28,8,6]

**Output:**

[22,28,8,6,17,44]

## Constraints

- `1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 1000`
- All the elements of `arr2` are distinct.
- Each `arr2[i]` is in `arr1`.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
  def relativeSortArray(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    ans = []
    count = [0] * 1001
    for a in arr1:
      count[a] += 1
    for a in arr2:
      while count[a] > 0:
        ans.append(a)
        count[a] -= 1
    for num in range(1001):
      for _ in range(count[num]):
        ans.append(num)
    return ans
```

<h2>Time Complexity</h2>
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) is the length of `arr1` and \(m\) is the length of <br>`arr2`. This is because we first iterate over `arr1` to build the `count` array, and then over `arr2` and the range up to 1001.<br>
<h2>Space Complexity</h2>
The space complexity is \(O(1001)\) due to the `count` array, which has a fixed size of 1001 elements, plus the space <br>required to store the result in `ans`.<br>
<h2>Explanation</h2>
1. We create a `count` array to store the frequency of each element in `arr1`.<br>
2. For each element in `arr2`, we append it to the `ans` list the number of times it appears in `arr1`, as recorded in `count`.<br>
3. For all numbers from 0 to 1000 (which covers the range of possible values in `arr1`), we append the remaining elements to `ans` in ascending order.<br>
